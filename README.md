This app is a cloud scaled app developed in node.js running with five different APIs developed in the Golang programming language. In this app, the users, payment, products, purchase history, and cart are separate from each other, but they join together in the main application. 

1. Sign-up or login to the application
2. Browse through the book catalog when you are logged in
3. View your purchase history
4. Add items to a shopping cart
5. Checkout the products in your cart
6. Add payment information on a form and submit it to a payment system

The following is the architecture for the website:
