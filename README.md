**Team Starburst's Project - BooksMart**
==============================

**PURPOSE OF PROJECT:** To build a cloud scale SaaS Service on Amazon Cloud and Heroku using the basic scaling design approaches.

This app is a cloud scaled app developed in node.js running with five different APIs developed in the Golang programming language. In this app, the users, payment, products, purchase history, and cart are separate from each other, but they join together in the main application. 

1. Sign-up or login to the application
2. Browse through the book catalog when you are logged in
3. View your purchase history
4. Add items to a shopping cart
5. Checkout the products in your cart
6. Add payment information on a form and submit it to a payment system

The following is the architecture for the website:

Run the node.js app from the main.js file inside the Apps directory
